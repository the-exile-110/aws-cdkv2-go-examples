## About this Repo <a name="About"></a>

This Repo is sample code that I wrote based on the documentation for AWS CDK v2.

Since I'm learning to write AWS architecture in Go, but there are few examples of CDK with Go on the web, and AWS has recently released the official CDK v2 version, I wanted to take this opportunity to learn and take notes at the same time, each example has been deployed/ tested by me to ensure its usability and extensibility as much as possible.

Welcome contributions to this repo in the form of fixes to existing examples or addition of new examples.

## Learning Resources <a name="Learning"></a>
Here are the learning resources I referenced while learning CDK.
